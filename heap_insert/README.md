# Heap Insert

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you - don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at - compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

# More Info
## Data structures
- Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.

#### Basic Binary Tree

```
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};
```
# Max Binary Heap
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
```
## Print function
To match the examples in the tasks, you are given this function

This function is used only for visualisation purpose. 

```

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "binary_trees.h"
